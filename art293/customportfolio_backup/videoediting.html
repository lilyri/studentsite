              <h5>– James Wedmore</h5><br>
              <p>Probably no one can deny that video content is memorable. Video of a wedding, video of exploring a new place, video of new products’ introduction. Video content has been such a powerful tool. Homepages, blog posts, social media profiles – video works for a wide range of platforms. 
                <br><br>My passion is to produce and edit videos. I start off with choosing a topic to think about what kind of information should be delivered to the viewers. Then I work on creating a story, in order to  take various photos and clips and put them together. The entire process allows me to use my creativity and imagination. The way I shoot a story affects the viewers' feelings a certain way. Just knowing I’m going to be meeting different people everyday is exciting and I love that no two stories are ever the same.

                <h2>Diamond Head - A Tour Info Video </h2><br>
                <h6>
                  Client:   Hawaii Navigation<br>
                  Service:  Video producing & editing<br>
                  Software: Adobe Premiere, Affter Effects, Illustrator, Photoshop</h6>
                  <p>This video is made for Hawaii Navigation which provides tourism information of Hawaii to Chinese-speaking travelers. The company had planned to produce exceptional video content to help communicate the beauty of the Hawaiian Islands with the guests. <br><br>
The request is to create a video to introduce Diamond Head. During production, I focused on providing the practical information and introducing the beauty of Diamond Head.
I created a scenario, wrote the script, chose the best music for each part, made a different effect, edited all clips. I enjoyed the whole process to make this video. My client loves the way it turned on.
